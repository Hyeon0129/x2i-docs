# TT-Forge: MLIR-Based Compiler
TT-Forge is Tenstorrent's MLIR-based compiler, designed to work with ML frameworks ranging from domain-specific compilers to custom kernel generators. It integrates with technologies like OpenXLA, PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow, enabling efficient compilation and optimization of AI workloads for Tenstorrent hardware.

- **TT-Torch** : Converts PyTorch models into StableHLO format using Torch-MLIR.
- **TT-XLA** : Connects JAX models via OpenXLA (PJRT interface).
- **TT-Forge-fe** : Accepts multiple formats and optimizes model graphs (built on Apache TVM).
- **TT-MLIR** : Core compiler backend that lowers operations into Tenstorrent-specific instructions.
- **TT-TVM** : Customized TVM integration for broader framework support.

Together, TT-Forge ensures compatibility and performance across frameworks, compiling models into deployable binaries for NPU execution.

# Utility Tools
 - **TT-SMI** : command-line tool used for **monitoring** and **managing** Tenstorrent hardware in real time.
 - **TT-Flash** : allows developers to **flash or update firmware** on Tenstorrent NPU through a simple CLI interface.
 - **TT-Topology**: utility to **configure Ethernet routing layouts** (mesh, linear, torus) across multiple Tenstorrent boards.
